# Household Energy Consumption Analysis (Day 1)

This project analyzes household energy usage patterns using Excel.  
It includes data cleaning, calculated metrics, pivot tables, and a dashboard with key insights.  

## Files
- `Household_Energy_Analysis.xlsx` → Main Excel workbook with analysis & dashboard.  
- `Household_Energy.csv` → Source dataset.  

## Key Insights
- Top 10% households consume 2–3× more energy than average.  
- Appliance count strongly correlates with energy use.  
- Seasonal peaks occur in summer and winter.  

## Recommendations
- Targeted audits for high consumers.  
- Promote energy-efficient appliances.
